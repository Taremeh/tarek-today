Use this tools to maximize your productivity in a variety of areas: coding, writing, general workflow, image processing and more.


## Content Creation

I am creating content on mass: I document everything I do (either in writing or as video). To keep the quality to a high standard, I need to leverage high productivity and efficency, such that I loose as little time as possible doing the actual task.

### Writing

- [KaTeX Symbol List](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) for quick math symbol reference when writing markdown.
- [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image) plugin for VS Code when writing markdown. Allows me to insert a clipboard screenshot directly into markdown files via paste shortcut.

### Image Processing

- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to combine two screenshots into one using:
    - `convert +append a.png b.png out.png` to merge horizontally
    - `convert -append a.png b.png out.png` to merge vertically



## Coding

## Writing


## General Workflow

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) as an improved spotlight for MacOS. Using custom script shortcuts. E.g. "Terminal @ Screenshot Dir" opens a new terminal in my screenshot directory, such that I can quickly operate on screenshots.
