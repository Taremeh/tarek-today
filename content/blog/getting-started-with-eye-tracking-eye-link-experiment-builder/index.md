_preface: I am using the EyeLink Portable Duo from SR Research for my bachelor thesis that involves eye-tracking. This tutorial should help you getting started with using the relevant software (i.e. ExperimentBuilder), such that you can setup your first experiment._

Use this getting started guide if you don't want to read through 400+ pages of the offical ExperimentBuilder User Manual.

1. Download **ExperimentBuilder** from [sr-support.com](https://www.sr-support.com/thread-1.html)
    - Note: You'll need a forum account to access the download page. Just [register](https://www.sr-support.com/member.php?action=register) an account, wait for activation and then proceed to the download page.
2. Install the **ExperimentBuilder** and the *HASP driver* if your sr-research USB license key dongle is not detected by your computer. 
    - How do you know if the USB license key is working? The physical USB license stick will turn on a weak red LED if plugged into your computer and if working correctly.
3. Start the **ExperimentBuilder** application
4. Let's start with a simple example. Go to the menu and select `File > Examples > Simple`. The following graph should appear. You can explore
