- had my first meeting as software lead at swissloop tunneling. Introduced my plans regarding Software Process & Quality Assurance (SCRUM, CI-Pipeline, Unit-Testing, Sonar Cube, Using VCS to full extend)
- published github repository for lumen rest api server (lacreme-restapi) I'm currently working on: https://github.com/LACREME-digital/lacreme-restapi/tree/013d7d1026af8c917ce50701847e2b94fec659c3
- added the ability to add services (offerten) to customers. Learned how to implement a one-to-many relationship, such that service objects are nested inside the customer. Also learned about the `nullable` and `default` function that can be added to the lumen database migration file.
- started to film an evening development review (going over code I've implemented this evening)
- thinking about taking piano lessons again, about planning the recording of my repertoire e.g. at the Tonhalle and having a small concert together with my brother. Filming the entire process from start (i.e. asking my brother today if he's in :) ), over the process of practicing being stressed out, behind the stage, experiencing the nerve wracking stage fright, ending at the concert / the after party :)
- thinking about contacting my highschool to produce theatrical performance of my book "MOMENT"
